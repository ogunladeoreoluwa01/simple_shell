## Introduction

This Simple Shell project is a collaborative effort by Oreoluwa Ogunlade and Hana Hussein. The goal of this project is to create a minimalistic Unix-like command-line interpreter using the C programming language. The shell provides a command prompt where users can enter commands, which are then executed by the shell. It supports various features such as executing external programs, managing environment variables, handling redirection, and more.

## Getting Started

To compile the Simple Shell, make sure you have `gcc` installed on your system. Navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o simple_shell
```

## Usage

After compiling the shell, you can run it by executing the `simple_shell` binary:

```bash
./simple_shell
```

The shell will display a prompt where you can enter commands. You can run simple commands, execute programs, and use various built-in commands.

## Features

- Displays a prompt and waits for user input.
- Supports executing external programs.
- Handles simple command lines with or without arguments.
- Implements built-in commands like `exit`, `env`, `cd`, and more.
- Handles the `PATH` to find executable programs.
- Implements logical operators `&&` and `||`.
- Manages environment variables.
- Supports comments using `#`.
- Provides input from files for batch execution.

## Builtin Commands

- `exit`: Exits the shell.
- `env`: Prints the current environment.
- `cd [DIRECTORY]`: Changes the current directory.
- `alias [name[='value'] ...]`: Manages aliases.
- `setenv VARIABLE VALUE`: Initializes or modifies an environment variable.
- `unsetenv VARIABLE`: Removes an environment variable.
